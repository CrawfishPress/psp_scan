Program is for reading PaintShop Pro files (.pspimage), and converting to bitmaps or PNGs,
including transparency layers. PNGs will have one Alpha channel mask save also.

Currently supports:
 - Files saved in PSP X format (file-format version 8)
 - Layers of type Raster/Mask/Group (adjustment-layers, etc, are silently ignored)
 - Layers saved in Uncompressed format (RLE/LZ77 formats not yet supported, code will raise exception)
 - Layer Groups, max of two layers in group (raster + mask)
 - One Alpha-channel mask (only first one is saved in PNGs)

# Requirements:
 - Pillow 3.3
 - Python 2.7

# Source:
ftp://ftp.corel.com/pub/documentation/PSP/PSP%20File%20Format%20Specification%208.pdf.zip
 - September, 2005
 - Paint Shop Pro (PSP) File Format Version 8.0
 - Paint Shop Pro Application Version 10.0 (or PSP X)
 - File Format Documentation Version 8.0

Note: in order to run this as a module, on the command-line, I had
to name this file `__main__.py` (instead of `psp_scan.py`). Still working
on the whole Python packaging thing...

# TODO - allow CLI to select mask-layers for input-directories, not just single files
# TODO - allow CLI to save formats other than BMP/PNG
# TODO - check visibility flag on layers
# TODO - add decompression code for RLE/LZ77 compressed channels
# TODO - handle more than two grouped layers - currently only layer + mask is parsed
# TODO - mask_to_alpha() - add 'use_raster' flag, convert RGB layers to greyscale
# TODO - refactor various layer/mask saving functions

# TODO - add info-chunk/header for other non-used blocks?
# TODO - add Channels to API?
# TODO - test import/api?

# TODO - logging
# TODO - fix fubar.background channel file-dump error
# TODO - refactor DEBUG output
# TODO - update to Python 3+
# TODO - convert tests to use fileIO objects, not write files
# TODO - determine the difference between the image.putalpha() and PaintShop Pro's PNG.save with alpha
